tech1,technical,ML,What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models whereas unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groupings."
tech2,technical,ML,Explain overfitting and how to prevent it.?,"Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. It can be prevented using techniques like regularization cross-validation and pruning."
tech3,technical,ML,What are precision recall and F1-score? Why are they important?,Precision is the ratio of true positives to predicted positives recall is true positives to actual positives and F1-score is their harmonic mean. They help evaluate model performance beyond accuracy.
tech4,technical,ML,How does a decision tree algorithm work?,"A decision tree splits the data based on feature values to create a tree-like structure of decisions aiming to classify or predict outcomes."
tech5,technical,Deep Learning,What is the role of activation functions in neural networks?,"Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model enabling it to learn complex patterns. Examples include ReLU Sigmoid and Tanh."
tech6,technical,NLP,How do word embeddings like Word2Vec or BERT work?,"Word embeddings convert words into dense vectors that capture semantic relationships. BERT is a contextual embedding model that understands meaning based on context."
tech7,technical,Project,Explain a machine learning project you've worked on.,"In my project I used logistic regression to detect Parkinson’s disease using voice data. I handled preprocessing model training evaluation and achieved 90% accuracy."
tech8,technical,NLP,How would you detect fake news using NLP?,"You can use NLP to detect fake news by extracting features like linguistic patterns and sentiment then training classifiers like SVM or BERT to distinguish between real and fake content."
tech9,technical,Python,What are Python libraries you’ve used for ML? What are their roles?,"I've used scikit-learn for traditional ML TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning and libraries like pandas and NumPy for data processing."
tech10,technical,Ethics,How do you handle bias in machine learning models?,"Bias can be reduced by using diverse datasets fairness metrics and techniques like re-sampling re-weighting or adversarial training."
